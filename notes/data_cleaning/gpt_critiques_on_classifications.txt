I. Immediate Assessment of Your Current Classification
What You’ve Done Well

Clear high-revenue contrasts (excellent design choice)

Lucentis/Eylea vs Avastin

Pregabalin vs Gabapentin

Oxymorphone vs other opioids

Dalbavancin vs standard IV antibiotics

These are strong “within-clinical-category” contrasts that isolate margin differences.

Inclusion of chronic low-discretion controls

Metformin

Lisinopril

Atorvastatin

These are ideal “low discretion” benchmarks.

Recognition of abuse-prone and grey-area categories

Opioids

Benzodiazepines

Muscle relaxants

Viscosupplement injections

These are commonly cited in literature as discretionary.

II. Where Your Current Tables Are Thin

Right now, your selection is conceptually correct but empirically sparse relative to:

10,000+ CPT/HCPCS service codes

500 Part B drugs

2,000 Part D drugs

Your current framework covers only a small discretionary subset.

You will face this critique:

“Why were these specific codes selected? What about the rest?”

You need systematic coverage logic.

III. Major Missing High-Discretion Categories

Below are important outpatient discretionary domains not yet represented.

1️⃣ Imaging & Diagnostic Intensity (High Value for Your Study)

These are classic physician-incentive test cases.

Add CPT families:

Advanced imaging (MRI, CT)

Nuclear stress testing

Echocardiography

PET scans

Grey-area example:

MRI for uncomplicated back pain

CT for mild headache

These are central to financial incentive literature.

2️⃣ Interventional Pain & Spine Procedures

You included steroid injections (good), but missing:

Epidural steroid injections

Facet joint injections

Radiofrequency ablation

Nerve blocks

These are high-volume Medicare outpatient revenue drivers.

3️⃣ Dermatology Procedures

High discretion:

Mohs surgery

Cryotherapy

Cosmetic excisions

Skin biopsies (borderline discretionary)

4️⃣ Infusion Therapy Beyond Oncology

You have biologics (good), but missing:

IV iron

IV hydration

IV vitamin therapies

IV antibiotics beyond listed few

Infusion clinics are high-margin.

5️⃣ Part D “Grey-Area” Expansions

Currently you capture opioids, sedatives, antibiotics.

You should add:

Proton Pump Inhibitors (omeprazole vs step-down)

ADHD stimulants

Testosterone replacement

Antipsychotics in elderly

GLP-1 agonists (if in your period)

Brand vs generic substitution broadly

The brand vs generic margin is crucial for your monetary incentive hypothesis.

6️⃣ Part B Drug Substitution Pairs (Very Important)

Your ophthalmology example is excellent.

You should systematically identify:

Clinical Indication	Low Cost	High Cost
AMD	Avastin	Lucentis/Eylea
RA	Methotrexate	Biologics
Anemia	Epoetin alfa	Long-acting darbepoetin
Inflammation	Steroid	Biologic

You need more within-indication substitution pairs.

IV. Conceptual Risk: “High Cost” ≠ “High Discretion”

Your current classification uses a “High Cost” indicator.

This will be attacked.

Economics critique:

“Cost is not discretion. Oncology biologics are high cost but often clinically required.”

Medical critique:

“You’re implying overuse without accounting for case mix.”

You need to separate:

Clinical necessity

Cost level

Degree of therapeutic substitutability

Guideline ambiguity

What you actually want is:

Therapeutic Discretion Index

Not simply high-cost indicator.

V. How I Would Strengthen Your Framework
Step 1: Build a Three-Dimensional Classification

For each code:

Clinical necessity level

1 = Essential (e.g., insulin in T1DM)

2 = Guideline first-line

3 = Second-line

4 = Grey-area elective

Substitutability

0 = No substitute

1 = Lower-cost substitute exists

Revenue margin proxy

reimbursement percentile within class

Then define:

Discretion Score = f(Substitutability × Non-essential × Margin)

This is publishable logic.

VI. Specific Additions to Your Tables
For Part B (expand beyond preview 

appendix_partb_drugs_preview

):

Add:

J0885 Epoetin alfa

J0881 Darbepoetin

J1453 Aprepitant (anti-emetic high cost)

J7050 IV hydration

J7030 IV saline

IV iron J1756

Botox J0585 (cosmetic/neurologic)

For Part D (expand beyond preview 

appendix_partd_drugs_preview

):

Add classes:

GLP-1 agonists

DPP-4 inhibitors

PPIs

Testosterone

Inhaled corticosteroids

Brand vs generic statins

Also add “brand-name flag” across all drugs.

For Services (You didn’t upload, but critical)

Add CPT groups:

70551–70553 (MRI brain)

72148 (MRI lumbar spine)

78452 (Nuclear stress test)

93015 (Cardiac stress test)

62323 (Epidural injection)

64483 (Nerve root injection)

These are essential to your hypothesis.

VII. Likely Critiques You Will Face
From Medical Community

Case Mix Confounding

“High MIPS scores correlate with sicker patients.”

Guideline Ignorance

“Your classification ignores disease severity.”

Undertreatment Risk

“Lower prescribing may not mean better care.”

You must adjust for:

HCC risk score

Comorbidity burden

Diagnosis-level matching

From Economists

Endogeneity of Satisfaction

Patient satisfaction may correlate with patient type.

Reverse Causality

High-prescribing may increase satisfaction, not vice versa.

Selection into Systems

High-margin providers cluster in certain markets.

You’ll need:

Market fixed effects

Provider fixed effects

Instrumental strategy or lagged design

VIII. Biggest Structural Weakness Right Now

Your classification is hand-selected.

Reviewers will ask:

“Is this comprehensive or cherry-picked?”

To fix this:

Map ALL drugs to ATC classes

Compute margin percentile within class

Flag top quartile margin drugs

Then identify which of those are therapeutically substitutable

Make it data-driven.

IX. What I Would Do Next (Strategically)

Merge all Part D drugs to:

Brand indicator

Generic indicator

Average cost per claim

Compute within-class price dispersion.

Define “High Margin” as top 25% of cost within therapeutic class.

Only call something “discretionary” if:

There exists a lower-cost therapeutic substitute

AND clinical guidelines allow substitution.

That shields you.

X. Final Assessment

Your framework is strong conceptually.

But:

It is currently too narrow.

It equates cost with discretion.

It lacks systematic coverage logic.

If submitted now, reviewers would say:

“Interesting hypothesis, but classification appears selective and not validated.”

If expanded as above, this could be a top-field empirical paper.
