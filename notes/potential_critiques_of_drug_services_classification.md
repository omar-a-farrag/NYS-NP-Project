The "Red Team" review is complete. I have scanned the Choosing Wisely guidelines and recent HSR literature (JAMA Internal Medicine, NEJM) to anticipate how a medical reviewer would attack our classification.

The "Red Team" Critique (and our Defense)
Critique: "You cannot lump Part B (Clinic) and Part D (Pharmacy) drugs together."

Reasoning: Part D is driven by patient demand/formularies. Part B is driven by the "Buy-and-Bill" revenue model (the provider profits directly from the spread).

The Fix: We will separate them into two distinct Appendix tables. This clarifies that we understand the different financial incentives.

Critique: "Dalbavancin is not 'Low Value'—it saves hospital days."

Reasoning: True. It prevents admissions. But at $1,500+ per dose, it is a massive Revenue Driver.

The Nuance: We will rename the column from "Low Value" to "High Cost / High Revenue". This captures the economic incentive (your thesis) without making a purely clinical judgment that might be wrong.

Critique: "Muscle Relaxants are standard care."

Rebuttal: Choosing Wisely (American Academy of Family Physicians) explicitly says: "Don't prescribe... for low back pain." We are on solid ground flagging Soma/Flexeril as Low Value/High Discretion.
