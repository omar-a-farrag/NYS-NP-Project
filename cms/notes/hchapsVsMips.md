# 1. HCAHPS vs. MIPS
## HCAHPS: Measures patient experience during inpatient hospital stays (facility-level).
## MIPS: A quality-based payment system for individual clinicians and medical groups (practitioner-level).
# 2. MIPS Origins
## Predecessors: MIPS consolidated three programs: PQRS, Value-Based Modifier (VM), and Meaningful Use (EHR).
## Focus: These were always focused on practitioners/groups, not the hospital facility itself.
# 3. MIPS Participation
## Who: Physicians, PAs, NPs, CRNAs, and various therapists.
## Requirement: Mandatory if a clinician exceeds the Low-Volume Threshold (>$90k Part B charges, >200 patients, and >200 services).
## Choice: Clinicians meeting only some criteria can "opt-in"; those meeting none can "voluntarily report" without payment penalties/bonuses.
# 4. Medicare Part B Scope
## Coverage: Primarily outpatient services (doctor visits, labs, ER).
## Inpatient Role: Covers professional services (the doctor’s time/expertise) while you are in the hospital, whereas Part A covers the "room and board."
# 5. Drug Coverage (Part B vs. Part D)
## Part B: Drugs administered by a provider (IV infusions, injections in-office, nebulizer meds).
## Part D: Drugs you self-administer (pills, inhalers) picked up at a pharmacy.
# 6. The "Donut Hole" (Coverage Gap)
## Status: Effectively eliminated as of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.
## New Rule: There is now a $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap for Part D drugs. After hitting this, the patient pays $0 for covered prescriptions for the rest of the year.
