# 1. The Four MIPS Performance Categories
## CMS evaluates providers on a 100-point scale Quality Payment Program (QPP):
### Quality (30%): Providers report on specific clinical actions (e.g., "Did I screen 80% of my eligible patients for high blood pressure?").
### Cost (30%): Calculated automatically by CMS based on insurance claims. Providers don't "report" this; CMS simply tracks how much the government spends on their patients compared to peers.
### Promoting Interoperability (25%): Focuses on Electronic Health Record (EHR) usage, like sending digital prescriptions or giving patients access to their online portal.
### Improvement Activities (15%): Providers choose from a menu of activities, such as "expanding after-hours access" or "using a surgical checklist."
# 2. The Provider-Side Workflow (The "Reporting" Phase)
## Data Collection: Throughout the year, providers (or their staff) tag specific codes in their EHR during patient visits.
## Submission: Between January and March of the following year, the provider submits this data to CMS via the QPP Portal. This is often done automatically by their EHR software or a third-party registry.
# 3. What Providers Receive from CMS
## Once the evaluation is complete (usually in late summer), providers receive a Performance Feedback Report:
### The Final Score: A number from 0 to 100.
### The Payment Adjustment: CMS informs the provider of their Payment Adjustment Factor. For example, a high score might result in a +2% adjustment, while a low score could result in a -9% penalty.
### The Two-Year Gap: There is a "lag year." For example, data reported in 2024 results in a score in 2025, which finally changes the provider's Medicare paychecks in 2026.
# 4. Public Reputation
## CMS publishes these scores on the Medicare Care Compare website. This means a provider’s "MIPS score" is essentially public info that patients (or researchers like you!) can look up to see how they rank against colleagues
